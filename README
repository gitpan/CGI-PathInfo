CGI::PathInfo

A somewhat CGI.pm compatible package for manipulating PATH_INFO
information in a manner similar to GET method forms.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Alternatively, if you have Module::Build installed,

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

See 'perldoc CGI::PathInfo' for the documentation.
